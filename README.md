# gpt_chatbot
This chatbot allows you to use your microphone to communicate with GPT-4. --Formerly GPT-3

It features the Pinecone API to create a longterm memory... it will loop in bits of conversation you've had, best it can.

Accounts and API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone required. You will also need to create an index in Pinecone.

It uses Windows TTS to respond, which might require some intial setup in your control panel/settings.

It also uses ElevenLabs API to respond with a realistic voice.  --DEPRECATED ELEVENLABS API IS TOO SLOW. Maybe someone has an alternative or can figure out how to stream the sound
